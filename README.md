# activity_classification
Using accelerometer/gyroscope signals collected via a smartphone, activities (push-ups, sit-ups etc.) are detected using deep learning (LSTM RNN) and repetitions of each activity counted. This allows for exercises completed during a session to be automatically logged without any user input.
